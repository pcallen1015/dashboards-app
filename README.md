# Dashboards

`dashboards-app` is an exploration into configuration-driven, grid/tile-based web application design. Some objectives:
* Configuration-driven: views (and groups of views) should be defined in data, allowing users/administrators to modify the composition of the application at runtime
* Plug-and-play tile/widget development experience: developers should have a framework for developing new widgets/tiles, and those new widgets/tiles should be easy to insert into the existing framework
  - Runtime onboarding of new widgets/tiles?
* Full-screen presentation: have the ability to display any widget/tile in a full-screen format
* Theming: ability to customize styling of application for different views/spaces
